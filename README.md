# Time Based Effects for SEG Senior Design Project


In this repository the code bases for 3 time based guitar effects are shown. There are three branches for the delay (main), Reverb and Chorus effects. The code can be built using the [JUCE Framework](https://juce.com) for windows and Linux. The binaries can be built to be compatible with Digital Audio Workstations by choosing the VST3 format in Projucer. 

An in depth description on the algorithms used can be found in the following Report:

Note that although the effects work Windows, the effects were designed to work in the Raspberry Pi's OS (Raspbian).
